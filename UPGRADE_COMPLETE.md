# TraderBlockAI Backend Upgrade Complete! 🚀

## ✅ Professional-Grade Analytics Successfully Added

The TraderBlockAI backend has been upgraded with three professional-grade financial metrics that real financial professionals use daily:

### 🎯 New Metrics Added

#### 1. **Extreme Value Theory (Value at Risk - VaR)**

- **Output**: 
  - `var_99_percent`: 99% VaR as percentage
  - `max_expected_loss_usd`: Maximum expected loss in dollars

#### 2. **Sharpe Ratio**
- **Method**: `calculate_sharpe_ratio()`
- **Purpose**: Industry standard for "risk-adjusted return"
- **Output**: 
  - `sharpe_ratio`: Annualized Sharpe ratio

#### 3. **Beta**
- **Method**: `calculate_beta()`
- **Purpose**: Standard measure of correlation to overall market (S&P 500)
- **Output**: 
  - `beta`: Stock's volatility relative to market
